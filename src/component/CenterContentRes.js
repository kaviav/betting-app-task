        Responsible Gambling and Self Exclusion Gambling means for the majority
        of our Users, entertainment, fun and excitement. But we also know that
        for some of our Users gambling has negative side effects. In the medical
        science is pathologic gambling since many years as serious sickness
        recognised. Since our first day we have thought about this problem and
        try our best to help. Under “Responsible Gambling” We understand
        multiple steps of measures, with which a gambling provider can help to
        lower the possibility of negative side effects appearing. -In case they
        already appear we also try to take active steps against them.
        <br />
        The most important instrument against negative side effects from
        gambling is knowledge and education about the risks of gambling to
        support our Users self-control in order to make sure they do not suffer
        from negative side effects. Information and contact

        <br />
        <br />
        We recommend you think about the following hints, before gambling in
        order to insure gambling stays fun for You and without any negative side
        effects: ● Set yourself a deposit limit Before you start to gambling ,
        think about how much you can afford to gamble according to Your
        financial situation. Play with amounts which are for fun and for Your
        entertainment
        <br />
        ● Do not try to win back a loss at every cost Try to not take huge risks
        to win back what you lost before at any cost. Play for entertainment and
        not to earn money.
        <br />
        ● Set yourself a time limit Set yourself a time limit and do not break
        it. Keep in mind gambling should stay in balance with your other hobbies
        and not be your only hobby.
        <br />
        ● Play smart: It is smarter to not play, when you are extremely
        stressed, depressed or under too much pressure. Also do not play when
        you are under the influence of Medications, Drugs or Alcohol.
        <br />
        ● Take breaks: You should take breaks when you notice, that you get
        tired or can't concentrate anymore
        <br />
        ● Only one account: To make it easier to have an overview of how much
        time and money you spend on gambling it is highly advised to not create
        more than one Account per Person.
        <br />

        Self-Exclusion:
        <br />
        In case You are diagnosed with a gambling addiction or try to stay away
        from gambling for a different reason, we want to assist you to stay away
        from anything that does nothing good for you. “Self-Exclusion” means
        that you exclude yourself, out of your own choice, from all gambling
        services. This exclusion cannot be undone for a set amount of time. If
        you wish to self-exclude yourself from gambling, please message our
        support and give them a time span between 6 months and 5 years. They
        also will explain to you all future steps and what is needed from you.
        <br />
        email: info@Betzhub.com Please keep in mind that Self Exclusion is
        permanent for the set time span and will not be undone for your own
        protection.
        <br />
        During Self Exclusion you are not allowed to create a new Account and
        every attempt to create a new Account during Self Exclusion is a
        violation of our Terms of Service and may result in the permanent ban of
        your original account. <br />
